## sublime-laravelgenerator

A Sublime Text Plugin which allows using [Laravel 4
Generators](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/Laravel-4-Generators) by [Jeffrey
Way](https://github.com/JeffreyWay) via the command pallete.


## Usage

* Open a Laravel Project
* Open the command pallete (Ctrl+Shift+P)
* Execute any of the available Generate commands

*Note*: `artisan` needs to be in the project root.

## Customization

The plugin is quite extensible. Interested users can extend the plugin for more
artisan commands by adding the appropriate entries in
`Default.sublime-commands`.
